## Course Information:
ECE 418 is a senior-level class on various topics in image processing. The course assumes a working familiarity with C or C++ programming, MATLAB programming, UNIX environment, and basic signal processing.
The laboratory sessions provide hands-on experience implementing image processing methods using C++ and MATLAB. Labs cover topics such as the two-dimensional Fourier transform, image and video compression, and image and video enhancement.

Topics covered:

- Image Manipulations
- 2D Fourier Transform
- 2D Interpolation/Decimation
- Human Visual System
- Halftoning
- Video Processing
- Histogram Modification
- Image Filters
- Compression: Run-Length Encoding
- Transform Coding
- Video Block Matching

## Installation

+ **C++** : the **C++** folders have **Makefile** which can be used to run the **C++** files. You can do this by running the following on the terminal:
```
make file_name_without_the_.cc
```
+ **Jupyter Notebook** : the **.ipynb** files can run in + **Jupyter Notebook**. No extra steps needed.
+ **MATLAB** : the **.m** files can run in **MATLAB** environment. No extra steps needed.
